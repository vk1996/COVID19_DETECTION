## COVID19 DETECTION  FROM XRAY SAMPLES ####

### OVERVIEW ####

[DISCLAIMER] This is a research project to analyse feasibility of putting
efficient deep learning models in production for detecting COVID19 samples from xray
as fast and precise as possible.

### Execution: ###
***To install required packages***
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The jupyter notebook covid19_classifcation.ipynb consists of all steps to train , test model

### Known Issues ###

As previously said this a research project and covid19 data is sparse , the results can be unreliable. 

### ToDo ###
Collect more covid19 data.
Visualize representation of model on both covid19 and noncovid19 samples
